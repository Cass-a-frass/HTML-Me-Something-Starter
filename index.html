         <h2>"City of Bones" - Cassandra Clare</h2>
         <p>"City of Bones" is the first book in a six part series that encompassed a large part of my high-school days. I found myself engulfed in this series in every extra moment. The reader will find themselves caught up in a world of warlocks, fairies, and of course shadowhunters. It becomes easy to become entranced as you learn that shadowhunters are powerful beings that use their runes tatooed on their bodies to fight all of the monsters that torment the earth. As you follow along you find youself wanting to be a shadowhunter and fight alongside the many main characters! With this being the first book in the series, it has a special place in my heart. This book will forever be in my top five books I have ever read.</p>

         <h2>"The Devil in the White City" - Erik Larson</h2>
         <p>"The Devil in the White City" is a non-fiction tale about the serial killer that ran wild during the 1893 World's Fair. The story runs parallel between the fair's main architect, Daniel H. Burnham, and the serial killer, H. H. Holmes. During the time that Burnham is constructing the fair, Holmes purchases a hotel across the street that is known to have nefarious attributes. It is the hidden basement, gas chambers, secret hallways, and trapdoors all allow Holmes to do what he does best - kill. Over the course of the fair, Holmes killed dozens of women by luring them in, giving them a hotel room, and killing them before they could ever leave. I found myself fascinated by the pure evil of this book in parallel to the plethora of issues Daniel Burnham ran into during his construction of the fair. The book is balanced and intriguing in ways I never could have imagined! </p>

         <h2>"Great Expectations" - Charles Dickens</h2>
         <p>When I first read this book I can honestly say that I hated it with every ounce of my being. I read it because it was mandatory for a class and I found that the pace that we were going was not conducive to my understanding. However, very recently I picked this book up again and found an interesting story with a multitude of side plots. In this story we follow Pip, a poor boy, who is sent to visit with Mrs. Havisham. While there Pip meets Estella, a beautiful girl, with whom he becomes entranced. Throughout the novel we meet several side characters that only make the story more interesting. All of a sudden Pip is approached by a lawyer offering him a trust that has been left behind in his name. The rest of the novel involves Pip struggling to grow up, find a job, and maintain a healthy love life. We follow him through his triumphs as he eventually gets on his feet and becomes a proper man in his society. I think for myself this book is intriguing because of the time period it is set in and the language that Dickens uses throughout. I found myself captivated by my attempts to decode the writing style of Dickens. I definitely would recommend to someone who is looking for something different. </p>

         <h2>"The Reptile Room" - Lemony Snicket</h2>
         <p>"The Reptile Room" is the fifth installatiosun in "The Series of Unfortunate Events" series. The series is based around 3 orphans who will inherit a large fortune from their deceased parents upon the eldest reaching 18 years of age. Due to the large sum of money, the orphans are targeted by a man named Olaf who is interested in snatching this fortune up for himself. The series leads the three siblings through harrowing events all stemming from Olaf doing everything he can to steal their money. I love this book in the series because it includes a giant reptile room that the orphans often play in and become friends with the animals along the way. We are invested in their story by the 5th book so it is hard to put down!</p>
