         <h2 id="mainHeading">"City of Bones" - Cassandra Clare</h2>
         <img class="left" src="./images/City_of_Bones.jpg" alt="Cover artwork of 'The City of Bones'">
         <p>"City of Bones" is the first book in a six part series that encompassed a large part of my high-school days. I found myself engulfed in this series in every extra moment. The reader will find themselves caught up in a world of warlocks, fairies, and of course shadowhunters. It becomes easy to become entranced as you learn that shadowhunters are powerful beings that use their runes tatooed on their bodies to fight all of the monsters that torment the earth. As you follow along you find youself wanting to be a shadowhunter and fight alongside the many main characters! With this being the first book in the series, it has a special place in my heart. This book will forever be in my top five books I have ever read.</p>

         <h2>"The Devil in the White City" - Erik Larson</h2>
         <img class="left" src="./images/DWCity.jpg" alt="Cover artwork of 'Devil in the White City'">
         <p>"The Devil in the White City" is a non-fiction tale about the serial killer that ran wild during the 1893 World's Fair. The story runs parallel between the fair's main architect, Daniel H. Burnham, and the serial killer, H. H. Holmes. During the time that Burnham is constructing the fair, Holmes purchases a hotel across the street that is known to have nefarious attributes. It is the hidden basement, gas chambers, secret hallways, and trapdoors that allow Holmes to do what he does best - kill. Over the course of the fair, Holmes kills dozens of women by luring them in, giving them a hotel room, and killing them before they could ever leave. I found myself fascinated by the pure evil of this book in parallel to the plethora of issues Daniel Burnham ran into during his construction of the fair. The book is balanced and intriguing in ways I never could have imagined! </p>

         <h2>"Great Expectations" - Charles Dickens</h2>
         <img class="left" src="./Images/Great_Expectations.gif" alt="Cover artwork of 'Great Expectations">
         <p>When I first read this book I can honestly say that I hated it with every ounce of my being. I read it because it was mandatory for a class and I found that the pace that we were going was not conducive to my understanding. However, very recently I picked this book up again and found an interesting story with a multitude of side plots. In this story we follow Pip, a poor boy, who is sent to visit with Mrs. Havisham. While there Pip meets Estella, a beautiful girl, with whom he becomes entranced. Throughout the novel we meet several side characters that only make the story more interesting. We see Pip work through triumphs as he eventually gets on his feet and becomes a proper man in his society. I found myself captivated by my attempts to decode the writing style of Dickens. I definitely would recommend to someone who is looking for something different. </p>

         <h2>"The Reptile Room" - Lemony Snicket</h2>
         <img class="left" src="./Images/The_Reptile_Room.PNG" alt="Cover artwork of 'The Reptile Room'"> 
         <p>"The Reptile Room" is the fifth installation in "The Series of Unfortunate Events" series. The series is based around 3 orphans who will inherit a large fortune from their deceased parents upon the eldest reaching 18 years of age. Due to the large sum of money, the orphans are targeted by a man named Olaf who is interested in snatching this fortune up for himself. The series leads the three siblings through harrowing events all stemming from Olaf doing everything he can to steal their money. I love this book in the series because it includes a giant reptile room that the orphans often play in and become friends with the animals along the way. We are invested in their story by the 5th book so it is hard to put down!</p>
